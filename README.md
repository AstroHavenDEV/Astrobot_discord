## How to setup bot for yourself

First what you want to do is open your command prompt and enter these commands to clone and enter the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/AstroHavenDEV/Astrobot_discord
cd Astrobot_discord
```

Once that is complete you want to create a file in this folder called .env and structure it like this
```
TOKEN=your token here
```

After you have placed the token in the correct file you want to install Discord.js and Dotenv

```
npm i discord.js
npm i dotenv
```

Now its time to run the bot, so invite it to your server with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=969140112199917643&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands) then run the following commands

```
node .
or 
node index.js
```
